# UI Refresh QA Checklist

- [ ] Spacing uses shared page shell (`page-shell`) across pages
- [ ] Typography follows text-display/headline/body/caption scale
- [ ] Buttons and badges use shared variants and consistent focus rings
- [ ] Movie/poster cards render with stable aspect ratios and smooth fade-in
- [ ] Loading states use skeletons without layout shifts
- [ ] Empty/error states show calm copy with optional actions
- [ ] App shell (TopNav + footer) appears consistently on every route
- [ ] Keyboard focus is visible on links/buttons; navigation works without mouse
- [ ] Dark theme contrast is readable on near-black surfaces
- [ ] Mobile layouts verified for main pages (discover, detail, search, curator, about)
